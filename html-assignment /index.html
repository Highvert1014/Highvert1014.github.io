        <p>
            Hello, my name is <em>Brad</em>. I am a 20-year-old full-time student at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>, studying web development.  
            At 6 feet (183 cm) and 203 pounds, I consider myself a sporty and athletic guy who finds his passion mostly in sports, particularly in 
            Basketball and American football. I also have a passion for languages, history, and technology. Exploring how other people communicate 
            both verbally and non-verbally, the shared and distant history between many ethnicities and political entities, and the evolution and 
            future of technology that has made life much easier—becoming intertwined into <em>our</em> culture and <em>our</em> daily trivial needs 
            as healthy, functioning human beings—fascinates me like no other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my other passions, I specifically chose this course because web development is about learning how to design, build, and maintain 
            websites using various technologies and programming languages. This field allows me to shape how people access information, conduct 
            business, interact, and experience the digital world. I believe in the ethical responsibility of providing accurate and meaningful 
            information, ensuring that people are not misled but rather guided toward further knowledge if needed.
